# Find Element In Code (Bridge)

This VS Code extension provides a bridge between your browser and VS Code, allowing you to quickly locate and open source code files containing specific elements from your web application.

## Features

- Creates a local server that listens for requests from your browser
- Searches through your workspace for specific code elements
- Automatically opens the file containing the searched element
- Provides visual feedback through VS Code notifications
- Supports multiple file types (`.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.html`)
- Status bar indicator shows server status and provides quick actions

### Status Bar Indicator

The extension adds a status bar item that shows the current server status:

- üì° Running: Server is active and listening for requests
- ‚≠ï Stopped: Server is currently stopped
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error: Server encountered an issue

Click the status bar item to:

- Restart the server when it's running
- Start the server when it's stopped
- Retry when there's an error

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.94.0 or higher
- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- A workspace containing TypeScript/React or HTML files
- The extension only activates when a workspace with `.tsx`, `.jsx`, or `.html` files is open

## Installation

1. Install the extension through VS Code's Extensions marketplace
2. Open a workspace containing your web application files
3. The extension will automatically activate and start a local server on port 12800
4. Install the corresponding browser extension (sold separately) to connect to this bridge

## Usage

1. The extension automatically starts when you launch VS Code
2. Navigate to your web application in the browser
3. Use the browser extension to select an element
4. The VS Code extension will automatically find and open the source file containing that element

### Server Management

The extension provides commands to manage the connection to the browser:

- `Find Element In Code: Reconnect Server`: Restarts the server if you encounter connection issues
- `Find Element In Code: Disconnect Server`: Stops the server if you need to free up port 12800

You can access these commands through the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

## Extension Settings

Currently, this extension doesn't add any configurable settings to VS Code.

## Known Issues

- Currently only searches in `.tsx` files
- Server runs on a fixed port (12800)
